In this project, I'm going to focus on electricity generation by renewable energy sources for each country. The actual list of countries I'm using was pulled off of GitHub at the following link: https://gist.github.com/tadast/8827699

Here are some questions I would like to answer (project aims):

1) How has electricity generation by renewables changed over time? 

2) What are the top ten countries in terms of renewable electricity generation?

3) Within the top 10, which renewable is providing the majority of electricity generation? 


The dataset containing data on electricity generated by renewables in kWh by country was pulled from The World Bank website.
